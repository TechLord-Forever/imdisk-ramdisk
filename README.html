    <h2><a name="ImDisk" />ImDisk Virtual Disk Driver</h2>
        <h3>Current version 2.0.9 built 26 August 2016</h3>
    ImDisk is a virtual disk driver for Windows
    NT/2000/XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10 and Windows Server 2003/2003 R2/2008/2008 R2/2012/2012 R2, 32 and 64 bit editions. It can create virtual hard disk, floppy
    or CD/DVD drives using image files or system memory. The install
    package installs a console-mode control program called <span
      style="font-style: italic;">imdisk.exe</span> and a Control Panel
    applet<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>. After install is
    finished, type <span style="font-style: italic;">imdisk</span>
    without parameters for syntax help or double click the <span
      style="font-style: italic;">ImDisk</span> icon in the Control
    Panel. It also adds a menu item in Windows Explorer so that you can
    right-click on a file to mount it as a virtual disk drive. Users of
    <span style="font-style: italic;">mdconfig</span> in FreeBSD will
    probably be familiar with the command line syntax of <span
      style="font-style: italic;">imdisk.exe</span>. The driver, service
    and control program can be uninstalled using the Add/Remove programs
    applet in the Control Panel. No reboot is required for installing or
    uninstalling.<br />
      <br />
      An additional driver, awealloc, in this install package supports memory 
      allocation beyond 4 GB limit on 32 bit Windows through address window extension, 
      AWE.<br />
      <br />
    The 
      ImDisk driver supports forwarding I/O requests to third-party image file format 
      handlers or to services on other
    computers on the network. This makes it possible to boot a machine
    with NTFS partitions with a Live-CD and use the included&nbsp;
    <span style="font-style: italic;">devio</span> tool to let <span
      style="font-style: italic;">ImDisk</span> on another computer
    running Windows on the network mount the NTFS partition on the
    machine with a faulty NTFS partition. This way you can recover information and 
      even run chkdsk on drives on machines where Windows does not boot. There are also instructions about how to use <span
      style="font-style: italic;">devio</span> under Windows on <a
href="http://grandstreamdreams.blogspot.com/2009/08/devio-remote-drive-access-and.html">Claus Valca's blog</a>.

      <h3>ImDisk Toolkit
      </h3>The ImDisk Toolkit is a complete package that adds a more modern and intuitive user interface to ImDisk. ImDisk Toolkit offers features like automated creation of memory disks at system startup and mounting many different image file formats. It is developed and maintained by &quot;v77&quot;. It is available for <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/imdisk-toolkit/">download here</a>.<br />
      <h3>64 bit compatibility</h3>
    64-bit versions share source code with the 32-bit version. All
    features and most limitations are the same in the 64-bit and 32-bit
    versions. One difference however, is that the 64-bit versions
    do not have any practical size limits for virtual disks backed by memory.<br/>
    <h3>Driver files are digitally
      signed with a certificate trusted by Microsoft.</h3>
      This means that ImDisk works on Windows Vista and later
      without running in testsigning mode.
    <br/>
    <h3>Special note for Windows NT 3.51</h3>
    The .inf file used in the install process is not compatible with
    Windows NT 3.51. To install on NT 3.51 you can extract the files in
    the packages using 7-zip and then manually create the driver keys in
    the registry or using a SCM control tool like <span
      style="font-style: italic;">sc.exe</span> in the Windows NT
    Resource Kit. On later versions of Windows you just run the package
    and it will install everything automatically.<br/>
    <h3>Source code</h3>
    <p>
    Source code for all of <span style="font-style: italic;">ImDisk Virtual Disk Driver</span>,
    including the <em>devio</em> server-side tool, API libraries etc is available as a
    7-zip compressed file <a href="../files/imdisk_source.7z">here (251.3 KB)</a>. Different parts of the source tree are built in different environments:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Windows drivers, command line tool and Control Panel applet parts of the source code are built with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=11800">WDK 7.1.0</a>. There is a <em>Makefile</em> in&nbsp;the source tree root that builds imdisk.sys, awealloc.sys, imdisk.cpl, imdisk.exe and imdsksvc.exe when ran with <em>nmake</em> in WDK 7.1.0 command prompts.</li>
        <li>The devio server side tool used with ImDisk clients in proxy mode, can be built with most *nix C++ compilers like gcc and similar. It can also be built in most Visual Studio/C++ command prompts. In all cases the devio binary you get supports listening for a tcp/ip connection and serving either a raw image file or a Microsoft vhd image file and parsing MBR partition tables to find offsets and sizes. When built with Visual Studio/C++ compilers, you will get a devio.exe that also supports listening for shared memory connections, the --dll switch to load custom dlls for accessing custom image file formats and features for auto-finding sizes of a physical devices.</li>
        <li>The .NET library located in ImDiskNet subdirectory can be built using Visual Studio 2010 or higher, any edition with Visual Basic support.</li>
        <li>There is an experimental Visual Studio solution with some project files for the driver, Control Panel applet, imdisk.exe and devio.exe. This is not yet ready for production use, but could be used to open files for easier editing in Visual Studio development environment, even if you likely need to switch to WDK 7.1.0 command line to build. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>API</h3>
      API functions are available for C/C++, COM and .NET clients. If you want to call functions for
    creating/removing/querying virtual disks from your own program you
    can #include the file inc\imdisk.h in your C/C++ source files and
    link the cpl\i386\imdisk.lib library.
      Read inc\imdisk.h in source archive for documentation about C/C++ usage. If you would like information
    about how to write compatible server-end software in C/C++ you can take a
    look at the I/O packet structures in inc\imdproxy.h.<br/>
    <br/>
      A class library DLL for COM and .NET developers is available as a separate
    wrapper DLL. <a href="/files/ImDiskNet.dll">You can download that
      DLL here</a> or an <a href="/files/ImDiskNet.7z">archive
      including the actual DLL along with import libraries and registry
      files for COM usage here</a>.
      <a href="http://www.ltr-data.se/library/ImDiskNet/html/b33f1e89-3d92-fc08-248d-14c5c2efd549.htm">
      Look here</a> for on-line documentation about .NET API. There are also, as usual, xml 
      files with method/parameter descriptions available to each assembly file.<br/>
    <h3>License</h3>
    I have received some e-mails with questions whether or not it is
    okay to include this driver in a commercial product. The answer is <span
      style="font-style: italic;">yes</span>, just like all other tools I publish here. However, note that a few lines of code are under the GNU GPL license. More specifically, the driver code related to floppy
    emulation. Some of the driver code is also ported to Windows NT from
    the FreeBSD 'md' driver.<br />
    <br />
    This means that if you modify the code and/or include it in and/or redistribute it along with your own product, all of the modified/integrated/redistributed product that you distribute needs to be redistributed under GPL, including source code. If you wish to avoid GPL requirements, such as the need to redistribute source code, you would therefore need to remove all floppy emulation related code from the driver. I 
    will be happy to do such modifications for you to make the code comply with your license requirements. Just send me an e-mail!<br />
      <h3>Compatibility</h3>
    <p>ImDisk Virtual Disk Driver is designed to be a small, simple and yet powerful virtual disk driver. It runs on very old versions of Windows NT as well as modern Windows versions. However, because of this compatibility design and because it emulates disk volumes rather than complete disks, it is not always compatible with all applications and drivers. For instance, you cannot manage things like mount points, drive letters and similar for ImDisk drives using mountvol command line tool or in Disk Management in Windows. As another example, you cannot create or access shadow copies on ImDisk drives. So, applications that use similar Windows features as Disk Management dialog to enumerate disks and disk volumes to find disk properties like sector sizes and similar, might possibly not work as expected with ImDisk drives.</p>
      <h3>Arsenal Image Mounter - If you need full disk emulation support</h3>
    <p>If you need full disk emulation, including integration with Disk Management, Volume Shadow Copy Services, mountvol and diskpart command line tools as well as better compatibility with applications, we provide another open source virtual disk project, called <strong>Arsenal Image Mounter</strong>. It is published together with <strong><a href="http://ArsenalRecon.com">Arsenal Recon</a></strong> and is available for <strong><a href="http://www.ArsenalRecon.com/apps/image-mounter/">download here</a></strong>. It is available for non-commercial use under AGPL license. Commercial license options available, please contact <strong><a href="http://www.ArsenalRecon.com/contact/">Arsenal Recon</a></strong> for more information. Source code, command line tools, driver setup packages and similar for Arsenal Image Mounter are available on <a href="https://github.com/ArsenalRecon/Arsenal-Image-Mounter"><strong>GitHub</strong></a>. The directory structure is desribed in
        <a href="https://github.com/ArsenalRecon/Arsenal-Image-Mounter/blob/master/Directory_structure.txt"><strong>this document</strong></a>.</p>
